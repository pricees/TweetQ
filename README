This is a simple queueing class that I wrote for fun.

Twitter currently allows only 20 status updates per hour, however you can get whitelisted and have the max go up to 20 000.

Just download the file and add it to any existing project

Required Libraries:
	Net::HTTP
	JSON
		
Example:

	thingsToDo = TweetQ.new(USERNAME, PASSWORD)

Add 

	thingsToDo.queue "Go run, you are fat!"

[....some time later....]

Get whats next

	tweets = MyQ.dequeue

See them
	tweets.each { |t| puts t }

Delete them from twitter
	tweets.each { |t| t.destroy }

See everything in memory from this session
	
	thingsToDo.master_queue.each { |t| puts t }
